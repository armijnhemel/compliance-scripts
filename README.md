This repository contains a collection of experimental license compliance scripts. They are not intended to be used in a production environment, but are there to explore possible solutions to license compliance issues.

* copyright-statements - experimental copyright statement printer, based on output of ScanCode
* diffstatverifier - experimental script to compare file names in a Git diffstat output to file names extracted from a binary such as the Linux kernel
* docker - experimental script to analyse on disk data from a Docker directory
* elfgraphs - experimental scripts to generate ELF linking graphs in Cypher to load into Neo4J
* osadl-audit - scripts used for the OSADL License Compliance Audit (LCA)
* sourcetreeverifier - experimental scripts to verify unpacked source code release archives
* tracer - scripts to trace builds, follow how files were created (originally from https://github.com/armijnhemel/yaminabe2/blob/master/src/process-trace.py )
