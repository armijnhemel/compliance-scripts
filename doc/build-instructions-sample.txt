These are the build instructions to rebuild the open source components for XXX Frobinator.

Please note: rebuilding the source code and reinstalling the resulting programs onto the device are not supported by our technical support department! Installing modified software will void warranty!

The instructions below have been tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS. Other Linux distributions have not been tested.

To rebuild the software you will need to follow the following steps:

1. install a (virtual) machine with Ubuntu 14.04 LTS 64 bit (desktop), with at least 30 GiB of free disk space available

2. install the following packages:
   * git
   * gcc
   * make
   * yacc
   * lex

3. create a directory '/src':

    $ sudo su mkdir /src

4. change the owner for the directory to your own user and group (for example: tux:tux)

    $ sudo chown tux:tux /src

5. change the environment:

    $ export FROBENV=FROB123

6. unpack the archive frobinator-src-0.0.1.tar.gz in /src

    $ cd /src
    $ tar ixf /path/to/frobinator-src-0.0.1.tar.gz

7. type the following commands to start the build:

    $ cd frobinator
    $ ./build-frob.sh

8. after the build you will be able to find the built binaries in /src/frobinator/build
